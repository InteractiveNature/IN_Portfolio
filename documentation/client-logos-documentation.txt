## 1. ADDING NEW CLIENT LOGOS

To add a new client logo to the scrolling section:

1. Add the logo image file to the `assets/images/clients/` folder
   - Recommended format: PNG with transparent background
   - Recommended dimensions: Approximately 180px width (height will adjust proportionally)

2. Add a new entry to the `clients` array in `js/config.js`:
   ```javascript
   {
     name: 'ClientName',
     logoSrc: 'assets/images/clients/your-logo-filename.png',
     logoAlt: 'Client Name Logo'
   }
   ```
   - `name`: The name of the client (used for the title attribute)
   - `logoSrc`: The path to the logo image file
   - `logoAlt`: Alternative text for accessibility (displayed if image fails to load)

3. Save the file and refresh the page to see the new logo in the scrolling section.

## 2. REMOVING CLIENT LOGOS

To remove a client logo from the scrolling section:

1. Open `js/config.js`
2. Find the entry for the client logo you want to remove in the `clientsConfig.clients` array
3. Delete the entire object (the lines containing the name, logoSrc, and logoAlt for that client)
4. Save the file and refresh the page

Note: You can also keep the image file in the `assets/images/clients/` folder for future use, as only logos referenced in the config file will be displayed.

## 3. EDITING EXISTING CLIENT LOGOS

To edit an existing client logo:

1. Open `js/config.js`
2. Find the entry for the client logo you want to edit in the `clientsConfig.clients` array
3. Modify any of the following properties:
   - `name`: Change the client name
   - `logoSrc`: Update the path if you're using a different image file
   - `logoAlt`: Update the alternative text
4. If you're replacing the image, add the new image to `assets/images/clients/` folder
5. Save the file and refresh the page

## 4. ADJUSTING SCROLLING SPEED

To change how fast or slow the logos scroll:

1. Open `js/main.js`
2. Find the `initializeClientLogos()` function
3. Locate the `scrollSpeed` parameter in the ClientsManager initialization:
   ```javascript
   const clientsManager = new ClientsManager({
       selector: '.logo-container',
       scrollSpeed: 43 // Adjust this value
   });
   ```
4. Modify the `scrollSpeed` value:
   - Higher number = slower scrolling (value is in seconds for a complete scroll cycle)
   - Lower number = faster scrolling
   - Current value: 43 seconds (recommended range: 20-60 seconds)
5. Save the file and refresh the page

## 5. MODIFYING LOGO APPEARANCE

To change how the logos look (size, opacity, color effects):

1. Open `css/components.css`
2. Find the `.logo-container img` and `.logo-container img:hover` selectors
3. Modify the CSS properties:

   ```css
   .logo-container img {
       height: auto;
       width: 180px; /* Adjust logo width */
       max-width: 200px;
       margin: 0 var(--spacing-md); /* Adjust spacing between logos */
       opacity: 0.8; /* Adjust transparency (0.0 - 1.0) */
       transition: all var(--transition-normal);
       filter: grayscale(100%) brightness(2.5) contrast(0.8); /* Adjust visual effects */
       object-fit: contain;
   }

   .logo-container img:hover {
       opacity: 1; /* Adjust hover transparency */
       filter: grayscale(0%) brightness(1) contrast(1); /* Adjust hover effects */
   }
   ```

4. Common adjustments:
   - `width`: Controls the size of the logos
   - `margin`: Controls spacing between logos
   - `opacity`: Controls transparency (0.0 = fully transparent, 1.0 = fully opaque)
   - `filter`: Controls visual effects
     - `grayscale(100%)`: Makes logos black and white (0% = original colors)
     - `brightness(2.5)`: Makes logos brighter (1.0 = normal, >1 = brighter)
     - `contrast(0.8)`: Adjusts contrast (1.0 = normal, <1 = less contrast, >1 = more contrast)

5. Save the file and refresh the page

## 6. HOW THE INFINITE SCROLLING WORKS

The infinite scrolling effect works by:

1. Loading all client logos from the configuration file
2. Duplicating the entire set of logos to create a seamless loop
3. Using CSS animation to scroll the logos from right to left
4. When the first set of logos scrolls out of view, the identical second set is already in place
5. This creates the illusion of continuous scrolling without any jarring transitions

The key components that make this work:

- `ClientsManager.js`: Contains the logic for loading and duplicating logos
- `animations.css`: Contains the `scrollLogos` keyframe animation
- `components.css`: Contains the styling for the logos and container
- `config.js`: Contains the list of client logos to display

The `ensureInfiniteScroll()` method in `ClientsManager.js` is responsible for duplicating the logos to create the seamless effect. If you need to modify how the infinite scrolling works, this is the method to edit.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

If logos aren't appearing or the scrolling doesn't look right:

1. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Verify that all logo file paths in `config.js` are correct
3. Make sure the logo files exist in the specified location
4. Check that the CSS selectors in `components.css` match the HTML structure
5. Try clearing your browser cache and refreshing the page

For more complex issues, you may need to examine:
- The `ClientsManager.js` file for the logo loading and duplication logic
- The CSS animation definitions in `animations.css`
